## Congratulations!!

You've done it! You've completed the fifth and final phase of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program! If you're like most Flatiron students, it's been a long journey: sometimes difficult, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately rewarding.

Take a moment to acknowledge all you've accomplished:

- You've learned frontend programming using JavaScript, one of the most widely-used and in-demand programming languages
- You've learned how to build out a backend using Ruby
- You know how to streamline and increase the efficiency of your applications using two popular frameworks: React and Ruby on Rails
- You've created a solid portfolio of projects that demonstrate your skills
- Most importantly, you've learned how to learn, putting you in a great position expand your programming skillset to include other languages and frameworks

Congratulations again â€” you can now officially call yourself a full-stack web developer!
